	<h3>About "For The Love of Quote"</h3>
	<p>
		Hi there,<br>
		I am Anna and I am a big fan of quotes. I think it is amazing how people are able to express a deep thought in just a few words.<br>
		When you read a quote, something inside you may respond. It strikes you because it somehow relates to something that you have experienced or because it shows that great people, successful in their chosen areas believe in same principles as you or show passion for the same values as you do. 
	</p>
	<p> 
		Here are a few quotes that come to my mind when times are tough:
	</p>

	<p>
		<div class="about-quotes">
			"Many  of life's failures are people who did not realise how close they were to success when they gave up." (Thomas Edison)<br>
			"Tough times never last, but tough people do." (Robert H. Schuller)<br>
			"Morning will come. It has no choice." (Marty Rubin)<br>
			"Do what you feel in your heart to be right - for you'll be criticized anyway." (Eleanor Roosevelt)
		</div>
	<p>
		This principle was already known by Aristotle who said:
	</p>
		<div class="about-quotes">					
			"There is only one way to avoid critisism: do nothing, say nothing and be nothing."
		</div>

	</p>

	<p>
		The brilliance in some quotes also lies in their wit and sharpness. They make you smile, smirkle or even laugh.
