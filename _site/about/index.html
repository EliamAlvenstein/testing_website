	<h3>About "For The Love of Quote"</h3>
	<p>
		Hi there,<br>
		I am Anna and I am a big fan of quotes. I think it is amazing how people are able to express a deep thought in just a few words.<br>
		When you read a quote, something inside you may respond. It strikes you because it somehow relates to something that you have experienced or because it shows that great people, successful in their chosen areas believe in same principles as you or show passion for the same values as you do. 
	</p>
	<p> 
		Here are a few quotes that come to my mind when times are tough:
	</p>

	<p>
		<div class="about-quotes">
			"Many  of life's failures are people who did not realise how close they were to success when they gave up." (Thomas Edison)<br>
			"Tough times never last, but tough people do." (Robert H. Schuller)<br>
			"Morning will come. It has no choice." (Marty Rubin)<br>
			"Do what you feel in your heart to be right - for you'll be criticized anyway." (Eleanor Roosevelt)
		</div>
	<p>
		This principle was already known by Aristotle who said:
	</p>
		<div class="about-quotes">					
			"There is only one way to avoid critisism: do nothing, say nothing and be nothing."
		</div>

	</p>

	<p>
		The brilliance in some quotes also lies in their wit and sharpness. They make you smile, smirkle or even laugh.
	</p>

	<p>      
		<div class="about-quotes">
			"I'm a man of simple tastes. I'm always satisfied with the best." (Oscar Wilde)<br>
			"Wine is constant proof that God loves us ans loves to see us happy." (Benjamin Franklin)
		</div>
	</p>

	<p>
		Some quotes keep you on track and motivate you to perceive your goal. These quotes are especially powerful when said by people you admire.
		<div class="about-quotes">				
			"Whatever you are, be a good one." (Abraham Lincoln)<br>
			"Being realistic is the most commonly travelled road to mediocrity." (Will Smith)<br>
			"Stay hungry. Stay foolish." (Steve Jobs)<br>
			"If one advances confidently in the direction of his dreams, and endeavors to live the life he has imagined, he will meet with a success unexpected in common hours." (Herny David Thoreau)
		</div>
	</p>
	<p>
		On this website I try to collect inspirational, thoughtful or just witty and funny quotes. So when I'm in the mood for some motivation, supporting words or a new impuls, I can just come to this website, take some moments and enjoy.
